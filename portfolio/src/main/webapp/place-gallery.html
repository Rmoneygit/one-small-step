        <p>Disneyland isn't actually my favorite amusement park, I just really liked these pictures I took when I went last December. My favorite amusement part is Knotts Berry Farm.
            The last two pictures are of a wilderness area near my house. I love that place, and I have explored it since I was a kid. I took these photos on January 1st of this year,
            as the sun was setting. It was a peaceful way to start off the year.
