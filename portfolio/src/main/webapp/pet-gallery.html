        I love taking picture of my dogs, like most dog owners do, of course. But I've always thought my dogs were particularly pretty creatures.
        I'm likely biased, but I do think they're better-looking than the average dog. The small white Bichon Frise is named Jake, and the larger
        Shetland Sheepdog is Molly. Molly is pretty old, going on 14 years now. Jake is younger, around 9.
