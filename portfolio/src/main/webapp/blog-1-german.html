            <h1>A first lesson in German Grammar ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª</h1>
            <p>I've been learning German for about a year now. I'm not good at it, but I have definitely made improvements.
                Because I like the language so much, I want to share some of what I've learned. So here's a good first intro to German grammar.
            </p>

            <h2>Gender</h2>
            <p>Unlike English, but like Spanish and French, German has gramatical gender. This means that every noun in the language has an associated gender.
               <b>German has three genders: masculine, feminine, and neuter.</b> There are some rules by which you can guess a German noun's gender, but generally,
               it's not predictible. This means you must memorize the gender along with the noun. The best way to do this is to memorize the noun with appropriate definite article in front.
               What's a definitite article, you ask?
            </p>
            <h2>The Definite Article: der, die, das</h2>
            <p>
                The definite article is simply the word "the". There's one for each gender in German: <b>"der" is masculine, "die" is feminine, and "das" is neuter.</b>
            </p>

            <h2>Example Vocab</h2>
            <p>
                Some words have an obvious gender<br>

                <b>der Mann</b> --> man <br>

                <b>die Frau</b> --> woman <br>

                Others, not so much <br>
                <b>der Bus</b> --> Bus <br>     <b>die Lampe</b> --> lamp <br>  <b>das Geschenk</b> --> gift <br>
                There's no clear reason why a bus is considered masculine, a lamp feminine, and a gift neuter.
                This makes things challenging to memorize, but with enough hard work and dedication, you can do it!
